step 1: input two values 'a' and 'b' that are guarranteed to have the answer between them
step2: sum the numbers (a+b)
step3: divide the sum by 2
step4: determine if the square of the number is greater or lower than the target number.
step5: if greater than the target number, replace the lower number 'a', else replace the greater number 'b'
step6: repeat from step1 - 5 until a the same number as the target number is obtained
